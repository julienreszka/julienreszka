## Programming principles debunked

### ~Don't Repeat yourself~ 

Generalize only after a threshold of repetition.
Duplications are less costly than wrong abstraction.

### ~Keep it simple stupid~ 

Architecture it such it can be perfected.

### ~You Ain't Gonna Need It~ 

Mistakes happen but Failure is not an option.
Make sure that if there are defects, they either have a workaround and they are in secondary features.

### ~Fail Fast~ 

Develop mechanisms of control.
Crashing an airplane won't teach you as much as using a wind tunnel to fly a model in an environment that you can control.
