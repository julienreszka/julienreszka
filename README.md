## Programming principles debunked

### ~Don't Repeat yourself (DRY)~ 

Repeat yourself.

Generalize only after a threshold of repetition.

Duplications are less costly than wrong abstraction.

### ~Keep it simple stupid (KISS)~ 

Don't keep it simple stupid.

Architecture it such it can be perfected.

It's highly unlikely that you will get it right on the first try so make sure you will be able to improve it on next iterations.

### ~You Ain't Gonna Need It (YAGNI)~ 

You will probably need this.

Mistakes happen but Failure is not an option.

Make sure that if there are defects, they have a workaround and they are in secondary features.

### ~Fail Fast~ 

Slow but steady.

Develop mechanisms of control.

Crashing an airplane won't teach you as much as using a wind tunnel to fly a model in an environment that you can control.

### ~Read the fucking manual (RTFM)~

You don't need a manual.

Make assertions.

Compare how you expect the system to work and how it is actually working, figure out the system like a hacker would.
