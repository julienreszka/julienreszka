## Programming principles debunked

### ~Don't Repeat yourself~ 

Generalize only after a threshold of repetition

### ~Keep it simple stupid~ 

Architecture it such it can be perfected

### ~You Ain't Gonna Need It~ 

Mistakes happen but Failure is not an option.
Make sure that if there are defects, they either have a workaround and they are in secondary features

### ~Fail Fast~ 

Develop mechanisms of control
