# 10 Popular myths about automation DEBUNKED

Automation is the use of technology to perform tasks with reduced human assistance.

Everything about automation isn't great, it has its pros and cons.

There are many myths about automation that are simply not true. Let's debunk them.

## Automation leads to higher unemployment

In theory, automation should lead to higher unemployment because jobs are replaced by machines.

In practice, automation leads to lower unemployment because automation creates more jobs than it destroys.

The claim that automation leads to higher unemployment is very easy to debunk.

Take a look at Japan, a nation that leverages robots more than anyone other nation what is their level of unemployment? The lowest of the top 10 largest economies by GDP.

The limit on how many businesses are created is the average upfront capital required to start a business.

Automation technology makes it easier to start a business because it reduces the upfront capital needed. So more businesses are created which leads to more jobs to fill.

## Automation leads to lower control over our lives

In theory, automation should lead to lower control over our lives because automation makes us more dependent on technology.

In practice, automation leads to higher control over our lives because automation makes us more independent of other humans.

The claim that automation leads to lower control over our lives is not very easy to debunk because control over our lives is difficult to measure.

However, if we had to simplify the measure of someone's lack of control over his own life it would probably be with low life expectancy.

If automation lead to lower control over our lives then we would expect to see a lower life expectancy in nations that leverage automation more than other nations.

Japanese people have the highest life expectancy of any nation.

Japan is the nation that leverages automation more than any other nation.

Therefore, clearly, automation doesn't lead to lower control over our lives (as measured by life expectancy).

## Automation leads to lower respect for human life

In theory, automation should lead to lower respect for human life because automation makes us less dependent on other humans.

In practice, automation leads to higher respect for human life because automation makes us appreciate human life more.

The claim that automation leads to lower respect for human life is not very easy to debunk because respect for human life is difficult to measure. However, if we had to simplify the measure of a nation of respect for human life it would probably be with the number of homicides per capita.

If automation lead to lower respect for human life then we would expect to see a higher number of homicides per capita in nations that leverage automation more than other nations.

Japan has the lowest number of homicides of any nation.

Therefore, clearly, automation doesn't lead to lower respect for human life (as measured by the number of homicides).

## Automation leads to higher employee well being

In theory, automation should lead to higher employee well being because automation gives us more time to do what we want to do.

In practice, automation leads to lower employee well being because automation takes car of easier tasks and leaves us the harder tasks.

The claim that automation leads to higher employee well being is very easy to debunk.

If automation lead to higher employee well being then we would expect to see a higher employee well being in nations that leverage automation more than other nations.

Japanese people have the lowest employee well being of any nation.

Japan is the nation that leverages automation more than any other nation.

Therefore, clearly, automation doesn't lead to higher employee well being (as measured by employee well being).

## Automation leads to higher carefulness

In theory, automation should lead to higher carefulness because automation gives us more time to think about what we are doing.

In practice, automation leads to lower carefulness because automation makes us more complacent.

The claim that automation leads to higher carefulness is very easy to debunk.

Carefulness can be measured by the number of traffic accidents per km.

If automation lead to higher carefulness then we would expect to see a lower number of traffic accidents per km in self-driving cars than in human-driven cars. However, the opposite is true.

Therefore, clearly, automation doesn't lead to higher carefulness (as measured by the number of traffic accidents per km).

## Automation leads to lower stress

In theory, automation should lead to lower stress because automation gives us more time to relax.

In practice, automation leads to higher stress because automation makes us more anxious about the future.

The claim that automation leads to lower stress is very easy to debunk.

If automation lead to lower stress then we would expect to see a lower stress level in nations that leverage automation more than other nations.

Japanese people have the highest stress level of any nation (tied with South Korea).

Japan is the nation that leverages automation more than any other nation.

Therefore, clearly, automation doesn't lead to lower stress (as measured by stress level).

## Conclusion

Pros of automation:

- lower unemployment,
- higher control over our lives,
- higher respect for human life,

Cons of automation:

- lower employee well being,
- lower carefulness,
- higher stress,

I will let you decide whether or not the benefits of automation outweigh the drawbacks of automation.
