# 10 Popular myths about automation debunked

Automation is the use of technology to perform tasks with reduced human assistance.

It has its pros and cons. However, there are many myths about automation that are simply not true.

Let's debunk them.

## Automation leads to higher unemployment

The claim that automation leads to higher unemployment is very easy to debunk.

Take a look at Japan, a nation that leverages robots more than anyone other nation what is their level of unemployment? The lowest of the top 10 largest economies by GDP.

The limit on how many businesses are created is the average upfront capital required to start a business.

Automation technology makes it easier to start a business because it reduces the upfront capital needed. So more businesses are created which leads to more jobs to fill.

## Automation leads to lower control over our lives

The claim that automation leads to lower control over our lives is not very easy to debunk because control over our lives is difficult to measure.

However, if we had to simplify the measure of someone's lack of control over his own life it would probably be with low life expectancy.

If automation lead to lower control over our lives then we would expect to see a lower life expectancy in nations that leverage automation more than other nations.

Japanese people have the highest life expectancy of any nation.

Japan is the nation that leverages automation more than any other nation.

Therefore, clearly, automation doesn't lead to lower control over our lives (as measured by life expectancy).

## Automation leads to lower respect for human life

The claim that automation leads to lower respect for human life is not very easy to debunk because respect for human life is difficult to measure. However, if we had to simplify the measure of a nation of respect for human life it would probably be with the number of homicides per capita.

If automation lead to lower respect for human life then we would expect to see a higher number of homicides per capita in nations that leverage automation more than other nations.

Japan has the lowest number of homicides of any nation.

Therefore, clearly, automation doesn't lead to lower respect for human life (as measured by the number of homicides).

## Automation leads to higher employee well being

The claim that automation leads to higher employee well being is very easy to debunk.

If automation lead to higher employee well being then we would expect to see a higher employee well being in nations that leverage automation more than other nations.

Japanese people have the lowest employee well being of any nation.

Japan is the nation that leverages automation more than any other nation.

Therefore, clearly, automation doesn't lead to higher employee well being (as measured by employee well being).
