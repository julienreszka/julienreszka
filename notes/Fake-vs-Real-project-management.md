# Fake vs Real project management

Project management methodologies vary widely, often classified into "Fake" or "Real" paradigms.

Understanding these distinctions is vital for effective project leadership.

## Fake Project Management: A Conventional Approach

Fake project management adheres to a rigid, step-by-step process consisting of initiation, planning, execution, monitoring and controlling, and closing phases.

### Phase 1. Initiation

Initiation involves launching the project, defining its vision and objectives, and securing approval to proceed. This phase assesses project feasibility and establishes the project charter.

### Phase 2. Planning

Project planning is the second phase, focusing on creating a detailed roadmap encompassing timelines, resource allocation, and risk management strategies.

### Phase 3. Execution

Execution is the third phase, where the project team implements the plan developed during the planning phase, working to deliver project objectives.

### Phase 4. Monitoring and controlling

The fourth phase, monitoring and controlling, entails tracking project progress and making necessary adjustments to ensure alignment with the project plan.

### Phase 5. Closing

Closing, the final phase, involves project wrap-up, stakeholder acceptance, and formal project closure activities.

## Real Project Management: A Dynamic Paradigm

Contrary to the predefined steps of fake project management, real project management transcends procedural constraints, focusing on the fundamental principles of economic value creation for the shareholders.

### Identifying Available Resources

Identify underutilized resources. (Supply/Demand)

- Capital markets
- Legal markets
- Labor markets

    So I had this moment, I'm sure all of us have these moments in our life where we make a change and everything changes after that. 
  
    I quit my job and I put everything, I have an old Honda Civic, I put everything I own in the back seat and the trunk of old Honda Civic, including a rolled up foam mattress. 
    I have a thousand hours of the bank and I called Joe and I said, I'm coming to San Francisco. 
    It turns out that Joe said, well, the rent is $1,150. So I actually can't pay rent. 
    It turns out that weekend, this international sign conference is coming to San Francisco. 
    We go to the conference website and notice that all the hotels and the conference website are sold out. 
    Then we had this idea, we said, well, what if we just turned our house into a bed and breakfast for the sign conference? 
    Unfortunately, I don't have any beds, but Joe had three air beds. 
    We pulled the air beds out of the closet. We inflated three air beds. We called it the air bed and breakfast.

### Focusing on Stable Opportunities

Focus on things that are unlikely to change. (Change/Time)

- Risks and uncertainties
- Rights and obligations
- Skills and abilities

    I get asked a very interesting question from time to time that I like and I enjoy and I answer and I play with; and the question is, Jeff, what's going to change over the next 10 years?
    And that's a fun dinner conversation.

    I'll tell you, there's an even more important question that I almost never get asked. And that is: what's not going to change over the next 10 years?

    And the reason that question is so important is you can build your plans around those things.

    So at Amazon, I know for a fact, customers are going to want low prices 10 years from now. That's not going to change.
    Customers are going to want fast delivery.
    They're going to want big selection.

    So all the energy we put into those things will continue to pay dividends.

    It is impossible to imagine a customer coming to me 10 years from now saying, Jeff, I love Amazon, I just wish you delivered a little more slowly.

    Or I love Amazon. I just wish the prices were a little higher.

    It's not going to happen.

    And so when you can figure out the things that are going to remain true under almost all circumstances, then you can put energy into them.

    Everyone's wrong, no matter who you are, everyone's wrong, some of the time.

    The most common error of a smart engineer is to optimize a thing that should not exist. Why would people do that? Well, everyone's been trained in high school and college that you gotta answer the questions, convergent logic. So you can't tell the professor your question is dumb. You'll get a bad grade. You have to answer the question. So everyone's basically without knowing it, they got like mental straight jacket on. They'll work on optimizing the thing that should simply not exist. Just make your requirements less dumb.

    Your requirements are definitely dumb. It does not matter who gave them to you. It's particularly dangerous if a smart person gave you the requirements because you might not question them enough. No matter who you are, everyone's wrong, some of the time.

    Then try very hard to delete the part or process. This is actually very important. If you are not occasionally adding things back in, you are not deleting enough.

    The bias tends to be very strongly towards, let's add this part or process step in case we need it. But you can basically make in case arguments for so many things.

    Only the third step is simplify or optimize.

    Finally, you get to step four, which is accelerate cycle time.
    You're moving too slowly. Go faster. But don't go faster until you have worked on the other three things first.

    And then the final step is automate.

    Now, I have personally made the mistake of going backwards on all five steps. Multiple times. I automated, accelerated, simplified, and then deleted.

    This is not the first tough time for Uber. And the much tougher time, frankly, was post pandemic. Our mobility business, which was our cash cow, lost 85% of its volume, overnight, within the context that we were losing two and a half billion dollars anyway.

    We were deeply unprofitable.

    And I was like, all right, let's go. And I took input, but I started leading, and this is not something that you do all the time, because you want your team involved.

    You got to be top down, you've got a solve for speed, and you've got to solve for decisiveness.

    Because even if you're decisive, you make a decision that's 20% off, it's better than being indecisive and not doing anything.
