# Fake vs Real project management

Project management methodologies vary widely, often classified into "Fake" or "Real" paradigms.

Understanding these distinctions is vital for effective project leadership.

## Fake Project Management: A Conventional Approach

Fake project management adheres to a rigid, step-by-step process consisting of initiation, planning, execution, monitoring and controlling, and closing phases.

### Phase 1. Initiation

Initiation involves launching the project, defining its vision and objectives, and securing approval to proceed. This phase assesses project feasibility and establishes the project charter.

### Phase 2. Planning

Project planning is the second phase, focusing on creating a detailed roadmap encompassing timelines, resource allocation, and risk management strategies.

### Phase 3. Execution

Execution is the third phase, where the project team implements the plan developed during the planning phase, working to deliver project objectives.

### Phase 4. Monitoring and controlling

The fourth phase, monitoring and controlling, entails tracking project progress and making necessary adjustments to ensure alignment with the project plan.

### Phase 5. Closing

Closing, the final phase, involves project wrap-up, stakeholder acceptance, and formal project closure activities.

## Real Project Management: A Dynamic Paradigm

Contrary to the predefined steps of fake project management, real project management transcends procedural constraints, focusing on the fundamental principles of economic value creation for the shareholders.
