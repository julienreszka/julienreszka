# How to make a cost effective solution

Make a work breakdown structure and label each work package with a defect severity score based on the following criteria:

- Non-Critical: Other work don't packages depend on this one.
- Has workaround: There is another way to get the same result.

Streamline the work breakdown structure by removing the work packages with the lowest defect severity score.
