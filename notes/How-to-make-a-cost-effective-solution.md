# How to make a cost effective solution

1. Make a product breakdown structure
2. label each product feature with a defect severity score based on the following criteria:

- Non-Critical: Other work don't packages depend on this one.
- Has workaround: There is another way to get the same result.

3. Streamline the product breakdown structure by removing the product packages with the lowest defect severity score.
