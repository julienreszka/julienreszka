# 10 Popular Sales Principles DEBUNKED

Contrary to popular beliefs, good sales people aren't aggressive.

It may seem like they are because some of the most aggressive sales principles have been widely adopted and celebrated in the sales community.

In reality, those principles were widely adopted because there are a lot of aggressive and bad sales people out there.

In fact, good sales people are often very patient and peaceful in their approach.

Let's explore some of the widely adopted sales principles that are debunked and rejected by experienced sales people.

## ~Understand the Customer~

In theory, Knowing your customer's needs, pain points, and desires is crucial.

In practice, Customers don't know what they want so it's a fool's errand to try and understand the customer.

### Offer guarantees

It's much more important to understand what promises the company is capable of keeping.

### Real life examples

#### Volvo safety

One company that has notably adopted a focus on guarantees and promises they can keep, rather than solely relying on customer demands, is Volvo.

Volvo is known for its strong emphasis on safety features in its cars. While they do take into account customer feedback and market trends, they have historically been proactive in setting safety standards and making guarantees about the safety of their vehicles.

For example, Volvo was the first car manufacturer to introduce the three-point seatbelt in 1959 and made the patent open and available to other car manufacturers for free. Despite not necessarily being a customer's explicitly voiced demand at the time, Volvo recognized the significance of safety and took the initiative to guarantee this fundamental safety feature in their vehicles, prioritizing the promise of safety over specific customer requests.

Over the years, they've continued this trend by setting ambitious safety goals, like their vision that no one should be killed or seriously injured in a new Volvo car by 2020. While this might not directly align with what customers are asking for, Volvo has made it a central part of their brand promise, focusing on guarantees they can control and deliver on, rather than solely tailoring their products to immediate customer desires.

#### Apple User Experience

Apple is known for its philosophy of designing products that customers might not even know they want yet. While they do conduct market research and consider customer feedback, their innovation often surpasses direct customer demands.

For instance, when Apple introduced the iPhone in 2007, it revolutionized the smartphone industry. At that time, consumers were not necessarily asking for a device that combined a phone, music player, and internet communicator. Apple's focus wasnâ€™t solely on catering to specific customer requests; instead, it aimed to create a product that seamlessly integrated various functionalities into one device, something customers didn't know they wanted until it was presented to them.

Apple's emphasis on understanding what promises they can fulfill, such as a user-friendly interface, seamless integration between devices, and a strong ecosystem of services, has been a driving force. They prioritize offering guarantees in terms of product quality, design, and user experience, often setting trends rather than solely reacting to explicit customer demands. This strategy has allowed Apple to consistently deliver products that go beyond immediate customer requests and shape entire industries.

#### Amazon Hassle-free return policies

While Amazon heavily relies on customer data and feedback to improve its services, it also places a significant emphasis on the promises it can make and keep. One of the most notable guarantees is Amazon Prime's two-day shipping for eligible items. This service promise, initially introduced in 2005, revolutionized online shopping by providing faster delivery times, which wasn't necessarily a direct demand from customers at the time.

Amazon also focuses on customer satisfaction with its return policy. They offer hassle-free returns for most items within a certain timeframe, making it convenient for customers to shop without the fear of being stuck with a product they are not completely satisfied with.

Additionally, their customer service is renowned for its responsiveness and effectiveness. While they do gather feedback and data from customers, their commitment to resolving issues promptly and efficiently goes beyond simply meeting stated customer demands. It's about ensuring a consistent, reliable experience, which becomes a hallmark of their brand.

These examples showcase Amazon's commitment to setting service standards and promises that prioritize customer convenience and satisfaction, even if those guarantees go beyond the immediate scope of customer demands.

## ~Handle Objections~

In theory, Handling objections effectively involves empathizing with customer concerns and providing solutions.

In practice, Customers may resist if they perceive a salesperson as argumentative.

### Ask for Upfront Payments.

It's essential to focus on customers who have already shown commitment.

### Real life examples

#### Kickstarter Backers

Kickstarter operates on the principle of asking for upfront payments or commitments from customers before a product or project is even created.

Creators or entrepreneurs pitch their ideas, products, or projects to potential backers on Kickstarter. Instead of waiting until the product is fully developed or manufactured, they ask for funding upfront to bring their ideas to life. Backers who believe in the concept or product can pledge money to support the project. These backers essentially commit to purchasing the product before it's produced or released.

This approach aligns with the idea of focusing on committed customers. Kickstarter emphasizes engaging with individuals who are already interested and committed enough to invest in a product or idea that they believe in, even though it might not exist yet.

By asking for upfront payments or commitments, Kickstarter allows creators to gauge interest and secure funding from a dedicated audience. This strategy demonstrates the importance of focusing on committed customers who are willing to support a product or idea, even before it's fully realized.

#### Tesla Model 3

Tesla is another company that has adopted the principle of asking for upfront payments or commitments from customers.

When Tesla first introduced its Model 3, it received over 325,000 pre-orders within the first week. This was a significant milestone for the company, as it demonstrated the demand for the Model 3 and allowed Tesla to gauge interest and secure funding from a dedicated audience. This strategy aligns with the idea of focusing on committed customers who are willing to support a product or idea, even before it's fully realized.

## ~Build Relationships~

In theory, Establishing trust with customers enables long term loyalty.

In practice, Customers don't want a relationship with a company.

### Ask for advice.

It's much more important to show that you are concerned with what they think about you. It doesn't have to be reciprocal.

### Real life examples

#### Airbnb reviews

A company that exemplifies the importance of customer concern without expecting a reciprocal relationship is Airbnb.

Airbnb focuses on providing a platform that not only facilitates transactions but also emphasizes the importance of trust between hosts and guests. Their system of reviews, verified profiles, and customer support demonstrates their commitment to ensuring both hosts and guests have a positive experience.

The company's approach involves actively listening to user feedback to enhance safety, quality, and overall experience. They constantly update their platform based on this feedback, ensuring that users feel heard and that their concerns are addressed. This dedication to improvement and responsiveness to user needs has helped Airbnb establish a strong reputation for reliability and trustworthiness, fostering long-term loyalty among users.

#### Amazon customer service

Amazon is another company that has successfully built trust with customers by focusing on their needs and concerns.

Their customer service is renowned for its responsiveness and effectiveness, demonstrating their commitment to customer satisfaction.

Additionally, their return policy is hassle-free, making it convenient for customers to shop without the fear of being stuck with a product they are not completely satisfied with. This approach has helped Amazon establish a strong reputation for reliability and trustworthiness, fostering long-term loyalty among users. They show that they are not only concerned with making sales but also with ensuring customer satisfaction.

## ~Be Persistent~

In theory, Pressuring the customer will eventually lead to closing a sale.

In practice, Customers don't like when things are rushed.

### Offer recommendations.

It's much more important to help the customer find the right match.

### Real life examples

#### Sephora stores

Sephora has a philosophy centered around helping customers discover the right products for their individual needs rather than pushing for immediate sales.

Sephora stores are designed to encourage exploration and experimentation. They offer various tools and resources like in-store samples, beauty classes, and knowledgeable staff (called beauty advisors) who are trained not just to sell but to educate and assist customers. These advisors take the time to understand the customer's preferences, skin type, and concerns before recommending products or providing tutorials.

By emphasizing education and personalized recommendations, Sephora creates an environment where customers feel supported in making informed choices. They focus on building relationships and trust, understanding that a satisfied customer who finds the perfect products is more likely to return and become a loyal customer, even if it doesn't result in an immediate sale on the first visit. This customer-centric approach has been instrumental in Sephora's success and its ability to create a loyal customer base.

#### Apple stores

Apple is another company that has successfully adopted a customer-centric approach to sales.

Apple stores are designed to encourage exploration and experimentation. They offer various tools and resources like in-store samples, workshops, and knowledgeable staff (called geniuses) who are trained not just to sell but to educate and assist customers. These geniuses take the time to understand the customer's needs before recommending products or providing tutorials. By emphasizing education and personalized recommendations, Apple creates an environment where customers feel supported in making informed choices.

#### Amazon suggestions

Amazon developed recommendation algorithms that suggest products based on previous purchases or browsing history. This approach has been instrumental in Amazon's success and its ability to create a loyal customer base.

They never pressure customers to buy anything but instead focus on helping them find the right match.

## ~Provide Value Propositions~

In theory, a sales strategy emphasizes pitching the product or service's features.

In practice, bombarding customers with technical details, emphasize how the offering solves their problems or enhances their lives is overwhelming and confusing.

### Utilize storytelling.

Crafting narratives that resonate emotionally with customers will be more impactful than a list of features. Stories help customers visualize themselves using the product or service, making it more relatable and compelling.

### Real life examples

#### Airbnb campaigns

One remarkable example of a company that leveraged storytelling to transform its sales strategy is Airbnb. In its early stages, Airbnb faced significant challenges in convincing people to open their homes to strangers for short-term rentals. Instead of solely focusing on the technical details of the platform or the features of the listings, Airbnb shifted its approach to storytelling.

They introduced the concept of "belonging." Their marketing campaigns highlighted stories of real people - both hosts and guests - sharing personal experiences and connections forged through Airbnb stays. The emphasis was on showcasing the emotional connections and life-changing experiences that users had while using the platform.

For instance, Airbnb's "Live There" campaign encapsulated the idea that by staying in an Airbnb property, travelers could feel like a local rather than a tourist, emphasizing experiences over accommodations.

These stories werenâ€™t just about the properties; they were about the meaningful interactions, connections, and life-changing experiences that people encountered through the platform. By tapping into these emotional narratives, Airbnb successfully connected with their audience on a deeper level, making the service more relatable and appealing beyond just its technical functionalities.

#### Apple campaigns

Apple is another company that has successfully leveraged storytelling to transform its sales strategy. Apple's marketing campaigns focus on the emotional connections and life-changing experiences that users have with their products. For instance, their "Shot on iPhone" campaign showcases the stunning photos and videos that users have captured with their iPhones, emphasizing the creative possibilities of the device. These stories arenâ€™t just about the technical features of the iPhone; they are about the meaningful interactions, connections, and life-changing experiences that people have with their iPhones. By tapping into these emotional narratives, Apple successfully connects with their audience on a deeper level, making the product more relatable and appealing beyond just its technical functionalities. This approach has been instrumental in Apple's success and its ability to create a loyal customer base.

## ~Utilize Social Proof~

In theory, relying on testimonials or social validation builds credibility.

In practice, customers are skeptical of reviews and testimonials.

### Leverage case studies.

Presenting real-life scenarios and tangible results through case studies will reinforce the credibility of your product or service. Highlighting how others have benefitted from your offering in similar situations can be persuasive and informative.

### Real life examples

#### HubSpot ROI

HubSpot extensively uses case studies to showcase how their platform helps businesses grow. For instance, they have numerous case studies that highlight the challenges faced by different companies in various industries and how HubSpot's tools and strategies helped overcome those challenges.

One notable case study is their work with the University of Oxford's SaiÌˆd Business School. HubSpot detailed how the school used their software to streamline communication, track engagement, and improve marketing ROI. By presenting specific metrics and outcomes, such as increased website traffic and lead generation, HubSpot demonstrated the tangible benefits of their platform in an academic setting.

These case studies not only highlighted the effectiveness of HubSpot's solutions but also provided a relatable story that other educational institutions or businesses could connect with. By showcasing real-life examples with measurable results, HubSpot effectively built credibility and trust among potential customers.

## ~Embrace Adaptability~

In theory, sticking strictly to a sales script might not resonate well in every situation and being responsive to the unique needs and communication styles of individual customers is key to building rapport and trust.

In practice, customers are confused when sales deviate from the script and can be perceived as unprofessional.

### Be consistent.

It's much more important to be consistent with your messaging and approach. Customers will appreciate the predictability and reliability of your sales process.

### Real life examples

#### Apple

When you step into an Apple Store or engage with their sales representatives, there's a noticeable consistency in the way they approach customers.

Apple's sales team follows a structured process and message, ensuring that key points about their products are highlighted consistently.
They maintain a predictable flow of information that aligns with their brand image.

For instance, when introducing a new product, Apple ensures that regardless of which store or sales representative you encounter, you receive a consistent explanation of its features, benefits, and how it fits into their ecosystem.

This consistency helps customers feel confident in the information they're receiving and creates a sense of reliability in Apple's sales approach.

While there might be room for personalization in addressing specific customer queries or needs, the core messaging and approach remain consistent, providing customers with a reliable and predictable experience across different interactions with the brand.

#### Starbucks

Whether you visit a Starbucks in Seattle or in Tokyo, you'll likely experience a consistent level of service, menu presentation, and overall ambiance. Their sales process is built around consistency in product quality, customer service, and even store layout.

The way they take orders, prepare drinks, and engage with customers follows a standardized process, ensuring that no matter where you go, you receive a familiar experience.

#### Apple

One company that's well-known for adopting a simple and clear communication approach is Apple. When they launched the iPhone, instead of inundating customers with technical jargon or complex specifications, they focused on the user experience.

Their marketing emphasized the simplicity and ease of use. Instead of bombarding customers with technical details about processor speeds or RAM, they highlighted the practical benefits: a phone that's intuitive, with a beautiful design and a user-friendly interface.

By prioritizing clear and simple language that resonated with everyday users, Apple made technology more accessible and appealing to a broader audience. This approach helped them stand out in the tech industry and connect with customers on a more relatable level.
