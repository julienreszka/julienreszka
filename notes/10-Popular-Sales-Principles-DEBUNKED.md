# 10 Popular Sales Principles DEBUNKED

## ~Understand the Customer~

In theory, Knowing your customer's needs, pain points, and desires is crucial.

In practice, Customers don't know what they want so it's a fool's errand to try and understand the customer.

### Offer guarantees

It's much more important to understand what promises the company is capable of keeping.

### Real life examples

#### Volvo

One company that has notably adopted a focus on guarantees and promises they can keep, rather than solely relying on customer demands, is Volvo.

Volvo is known for its strong emphasis on safety features in its cars. While they do take into account customer feedback and market trends, they have historically been proactive in setting safety standards and making guarantees about the safety of their vehicles.

For example, Volvo was the first car manufacturer to introduce the three-point seatbelt in 1959 and made the patent open and available to other car manufacturers for free. Despite not necessarily being a customer's explicitly voiced demand at the time, Volvo recognized the significance of safety and took the initiative to guarantee this fundamental safety feature in their vehicles, prioritizing the promise of safety over specific customer requests.

Over the years, they've continued this trend by setting ambitious safety goals, like their vision that no one should be killed or seriously injured in a new Volvo car by 2020. While this might not directly align with what customers are asking for, Volvo has made it a central part of their brand promise, focusing on guarantees they can control and deliver on, rather than solely tailoring their products to immediate customer desires.

#### Apple

Apple is known for its philosophy of designing products that customers might not even know they want yet. While they do conduct market research and consider customer feedback, their innovation often surpasses direct customer demands.

For instance, when Apple introduced the iPhone in 2007, it revolutionized the smartphone industry. At that time, consumers were not necessarily asking for a device that combined a phone, music player, and internet communicator. Apple's focus wasnâ€™t solely on catering to specific customer requests; instead, it aimed to create a product that seamlessly integrated various functionalities into one device, something customers didn't know they wanted until it was presented to them.

Apple's emphasis on understanding what promises they can fulfill, such as a user-friendly interface, seamless integration between devices, and a strong ecosystem of services, has been a driving force. They prioritize offering guarantees in terms of product quality, design, and user experience, often setting trends rather than solely reacting to explicit customer demands. This strategy has allowed Apple to consistently deliver products that go beyond immediate customer requests and shape entire industries.

#### Amazon

While Amazon heavily relies on customer data and feedback to improve its services, it also places a significant emphasis on the promises it can make and keep. One of the most notable guarantees is Amazon Prime's two-day shipping for eligible items. This service promise, initially introduced in 2005, revolutionized online shopping by providing faster delivery times, which wasn't necessarily a direct demand from customers at the time.

Amazon also focuses on customer satisfaction with its return policy. They offer hassle-free returns for most items within a certain timeframe, making it convenient for customers to shop without the fear of being stuck with a product they are not completely satisfied with.

Additionally, their customer service is renowned for its responsiveness and effectiveness. While they do gather feedback and data from customers, their commitment to resolving issues promptly and efficiently goes beyond simply meeting stated customer demands. It's about ensuring a consistent, reliable experience, which becomes a hallmark of their brand.

These examples showcase Amazon's commitment to setting service standards and promises that prioritize customer convenience and satisfaction, even if those guarantees go beyond the immediate scope of customer demands.

## ~Handle Objections~
