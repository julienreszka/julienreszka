# Types of successful startups

## Successful startups exit strategies

I nailed down three primary routes to startup success, and each path has its own strategic moves. Let's break it down with some grounded wisdom.

**1. Get Acquired: Play the Dangerous Game**

- **Stagnant Market:** If the market is full of big players sitting comfortably, you need to shake things up. Your goal is to create enough disruption or innovation that the big dogs see you as a threat. Think about building tech that makes their existing solutions look outdated or finding a niche they're neglecting and dominating it.
- **Be a Bait:** Make your company so appealing that an acquisition seems like the best way for them to neutralize the threat. This could mean unique technology, a loyal user base, or intellectual property that fills their gaps.
- **Read annual reports:** Public companies are required ro disclose risks to shareholder so it’s good way to find what they need.
- **Example of companies that used this strategy:**
  - Instagram, WhatsApp, acquired by Facebook.
  - YouTube, Android, acquired by Google.
  - Linkedin, Skype, Github, Sunrise acquired by Microsoft.
  - Looksery, Zenly, acquired by Snapchat.

**2. Go Public: Ride the Hype**

- **Fast Growing Market:** When the market is expanding rapidly, you need to scale quickly. Investors love growth; they want to see exponential user or revenue increase. FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) is your friend here.
- **Hype Train:** Building a strong narrative around your growth potential can help drive up valuation. Think Uber or Airbnb during their heydays. It’s not just about having a great product; it’s about selling the vision and potential to investors.
- **Example of companies that used this strategy:**
  - Uber,
  - Airbnb,
  - Zoom.
  - Lyft,
  - Slack,
  - Pinterest,

**3. Be Profitable: Play the Long Game**

- **High-Margin Market:** Here, the focus is on efficiency and profitability. Find a market where customers are willing to pay a premium and then figure out how to serve them cost-effectively. This often involves either cutting-edge innovation or brilliant business models.
- **Cash Cow:** Once you're profitable, dividends can provide steady income, and your major shareholding turns into a golden goose. This is more about sustainable growth and less about the flashy IPO or acquisition.
- **Example of companies that used this strategy:**
  - Basecamp,
  - Mailchimp,
  - Google,
  - Microsoft,
  - Apple,
  - Shopify,
  - Stripe,
  - Facebook.

**Strategy Breakdown:**

- **Stagnant Market Strategy:** Disrupt. Be the thorn in the side of the big players until they decide it’s easier to buy you out than compete.
- **Fast Growing Market Strategy:** Scale. Get big fast, build the hype, and leverage investor FOMO to drive up your valuation.
- **High-Margin Market Strategy:** Optimize. Focus on profitability and efficiency, then enjoy the dividends as a major shareholder.

In essence, choose your battleground wisely. Disrupt where there’s complacency, scale where there’s growth, and optimize where there’s profitability. Each path has its own risks and rewards, but understanding the landscape and executing the right strategy can lead you to startup success.
