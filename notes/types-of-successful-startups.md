# Types of successful startups

I see three main ways to have a successful startup.

- The company gets bought because you have valuable assets and the acquisition makes you and your investors rich.

- The company has an IPO and the valuation of the stock makes you and your investors rich.

- The company is profitable and you are a major shareholder so you can have dividends and that makes you and your investors rich.

So you have at least 3 ways to make a successful startup.

- Find a stagnant market, become dangerous enough to incumbents such that they would rather buy you than let the competitor buy you.

- Find a fast growing market, grow your customer base very quickly such that investors have a fear of missing out.

- Find a market with huge margins, make a cost effective solution and get a chunk of it.
