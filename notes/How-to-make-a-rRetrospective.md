# How to make a retrospective

The popular way to run a retrospective is to ask the team three questions to brainstorm ideas:

1. What should we stop doing?
2. What should we start doing?
3. What should we continue doing?

And then the team writes the answers on post-its and stick them on a board.

This is a terrible way to run a retrospective because it leads to a messy board with post-its all over the place and not a single refined idea.

A good way to run a retrospective is to ask the team to think and write well thought out and refined answers to the following questions:

- How to use our energy more efficiently? (Explain the high transformation costs) (Output/Input)
- How to source more strategically? (Explain the inflation of products) (Supply/Demand)

The answers must have an introduction, a body and a conclusion.

If some of the members are incapable of writing sentences they are not fit to make decision and should not participate in the retrospective.
