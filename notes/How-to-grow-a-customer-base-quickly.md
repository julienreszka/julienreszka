# How to grow a customer base quickly

Make a product that customers want.

Make sure that :

1. Your product is solving a problem your customers are expected to have
   - so that your customers will not try to hide the fact that they are using your product.
   - For example: Imagine a company that sells a treatment for a condition like bad breath or excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis). These are issues that people might find embarrassing, so even if the product is effective, customers might not want others to know they're using it. For example, a discreet pill for bad breath might be something someone keeps hidden in their bag, taking it privately because they donâ€™t want to draw attention to the fact that they struggle with bad breath.
2. Your product when purchased by your customers will make them look good
   - so that your customers will be proud to share it with others.
   - For example: Imagine a company that sells a luxury car. When someone buys a luxury car, they might be proud to show it off to their friends and family. They might post pictures of it on social media, or they might invite people over to see it in person. This is because a luxury car is a status symbol, and owning one can make someone feel successful, wealthy, and important. When someone buys a luxury car, they want others to know about it because it makes them look good.
3. Your product rewards your customers when they are bringing more customer to your product
   - so that your customers will be motivated to share it with others.
   - For example: Imagine a company that sells a subscription to a streaming service. When someone signs up for the streaming service, they might be given a referral code that they can share with their friends and family. If someone uses their referral code to sign up for the streaming service, the person who shared the code might get a discount on their next month's subscription. This is a win-win situation because the person who shared the code gets a reward for bringing in a new customer, and the person who signed up gets a discount on their subscription. This encourages people to share the streaming service with others because they know they will be rewarded for doing so.
4. Your product marketing material is easy to bookmark, remember, and share
   - so that your customers won't forget about it and will be able to share it with others.
   - For example: Imagine a company that sells a new type of toothpaste. The toothpaste comes in a bright, colorful tube with a catchy name and a fun logo. The company's marketing materials include a jingle that gets stuck in your head, a mascot that you can't help but love, and a tagline that you find yourself repeating to your friends. The toothpaste is so memorable and shareable that you can't help but tell everyone you know about it. You might even post about it on social media, or you might send a link to the company's website to your friends and family. This is because the toothpaste is fun, entertaining, and easy to remember, so you want to share it with others.
5. Your product is socially acceptable and encouraged
   - so that your customers will talk about it with their friends, family, colleagues, and even strangers.
   - For example: Imagine a company that sells a new type of reusable water bottle. The water bottle is made from sustainable materials, it's easy to clean, and it comes in a variety of fun colors and designs. The company's marketing materials emphasize the importance of reducing plastic waste and staying hydrated, and they encourage customers to bring their water bottle with them wherever they go. The water bottle is so socially acceptable and encouraged that you see people carrying it around everywhere you go. You might even strike up a conversation with a stranger about the water bottle, or you might ask a colleague where they got theirs. This is because the water bottle is not only practical and environmentally friendly, but it's also a conversation starter that brings people together.
6. Your product is entertaining, useful, visually appealing, and has a personal connection to your customers
   - so that your customers will find it sticky and will keep coming back to it.
   - For example: Imagine a company that sells a mobile game. The game is addictive, challenging, and fun to play, with colorful graphics, catchy music, and engaging characters. The game is also personalized to each player, with customizable avatars, in-game rewards, and social features that allow you to connect with friends and compete with others. The game is so entertaining, useful, visually appealing, and personal that you find yourself playing it every day, sharing it with your friends, and spending money on in-app purchases. This is because the game is not just a way to pass the time, but a way to connect with others, challenge yourself, and express your personality. You have a personal connection to the game, so you keep coming back to it again and again.
