# About employee well-being

Employee well being is not an easy thing to study because of all the lies and hypocrisy.

However, there are some indicators that can be used to measure employee well-being.

For example the duration of sleep could be a good indicator of employee well-being.

Japan and Singapore have among the lowest average duration of sleep in the world.

Netherlands, New Zealand and France have among the highest average duration of sleep in the world.

Netherlands, New Zealand and France, all have put an emphasis on giving time for rest and relaxation either through lower working hours or through more flexible working hours.
