# Fake vs Real delivery

## Fake delivery

In theory, refactoring is a good practice that can lead to a more maintainable and scalable codebase.

In practice, there are several challenges and drawbacks that can make it less appealing or even counterproductive in certain situations:

- Illusion of Progress: Refactoring can create an illusion of progress without actually delivering tangible value to customers. This can lead to a false sense of accomplishment and distract developers from more pressing priorities.

- Risk of Introducing Bugs: Even though refactoring aims to improve the codebase, it can inadvertently introduce bugs or regressions if not done carefully and thoroughly tested.

- Opportunity Cost: Time and resources spent on refactoring could potentially delay the implementation of new features or the resolution of existing issues that directly impact customers.

- Over-Engineering: Refactoring can sometimes lead to over-engineering, where developers try to make the codebase more generic or flexible than necessary. This can increase complexity and maintenance costs without providing significant benefits.

- Potential disruption: Refactoring can disrupt the development process and team dynamics, especially if not everyone agrees on the need for refactoring or the approach to be taken.

- Lack of Clear Goals: Refactoring without clear goals or metrics to measure its impact can make it difficult to assess its effectiveness and justify the investment in time and resources.

## Real delivery

To avoid these pitfalls, it is important to weight whether a refactoring will actually increase the speed of development, reduce the number of critical bugs with no workaround.

It's usually a trade-off between speed of development and bug fixing.
