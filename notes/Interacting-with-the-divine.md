# Interacting with the divine

## Be mindful of what you pray for.

You cannot ask God to act on your behalf because God is not your servant.

Explanation: You must approach god with humility, God has a plan and won’t take commands like you would expect from a genie. We are only humans and incapable of giving clear and complete instructions, anything we would ask to get on our behalf would backfire and cause more harm than good.

## Be mindful of your strengths.

You may ask God to act on his behalf but he will only give you the power that you can take.

Explanation: You must approach God with fervour and readiness to act. Do not ask to do things that are too big for you that you are not ready to commit to doing yourself.

## Be mindful of your own limitations.

You cannot ask God for the power to do everything because only God is all powerful.

Explanation: You must focus on doing a handful of things well. Even with God’s strength you will only be able to do so much.

## Be mindful of how you enter and exit people’s lives.

You may find God in the void that separates you from others but he won’t help you fill the gap.

Explanation: You must take an active role of connecting with other people. Even if God offers guidance and comfort you must do the effort to make mend and bridge divides.
