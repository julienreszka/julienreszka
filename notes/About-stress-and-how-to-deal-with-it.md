# About stress and how to deal with it

Fear and anxiety shrinks the brain and makes you stupid. If you rely on intelligence for your work why would you ever allow something to make you anxious.

It's not a secret that propagandists hijack survival instincts for psychological manipulation:

- emotional appeal
- us/them
- simplifications of complex issues
- repetition and consistency
- perceived threads

Don't let your primitive instincts take over

Be mindful of where you focus your attention. Focus on what’s actionnable right now, be prepared but never anticipate nor procrastinate. Don’t worry about that which you can’t control. Be humble about what you think you control.
