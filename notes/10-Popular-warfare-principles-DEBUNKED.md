# 10 Popular warfare principles DEBUNKED

Warfare is the engagement in or the activities involved in war or conflict.
There are many myths about warfare that are simply not true. Let's debunk them.

## ~Concentration of force~

In theory, concentrating force should lead to a decisive victory because it allows for overwhelming power at a critical point.
In practice, concentration risks vulnerability to precision strikes and may conflict with the need for agility and multi-domain operations.

### Fluidity

Whenever the enemy pushes, you should reshape and adapt to maintain integrity and avoid being overwhelmed. Be like water, flowing around obstacles and finding the path of least resistance. Concentration of force can lead to rigidity and vulnerability.

### Real life examples of disastrous consequences of following the principle of concentration of force

#### Battle of the Somme british offensive (1916)

At the Battle of the Somme, British forces concentrated troops in a single offensive, resulting in massive casualties without achieving significant breakthroughs. The concentration of forces made them vulnerable to German artillery and machine gun fire.

British casualties totaled about 420,000, including 57,470 on the first day alone, with 19,240 killed that day

#### Battle of Stalingrad (1942-1943)

At the Battle of Stalingrad, German forces concentrated power but became encircled due to lack of operational flexibility, suffering devastating casualties. Concentration was exploited by Soviet forces emphasizing encirclement and attrition.

Axis casualties, including German and allied forces, ranged from about 647,000 to 968,000 total killed, wounded, or captured, with around 235,000 captured in the battle alone. Only about 5,000 of these POWs returned to Germany after the war

#### Battle of Kursk (1943)

At the Battle of Kursk, the German strategy of concentrating forces in a single area led to a catastrophic defeat when Soviet forces launched a massive counteroffensive, exploiting the Germans' overextended supply lines and lack of reserves. The amount of casualties was staggering, with over 200,000 German soldiers killed or wounded.

Around 200,000 Germans killed, wounded, or missing.

#### Battle of Dien Bien Phu (1954)

The French forces concentrated at Dien Bien Phu, believing they could hold the valley against the Viet Minh. However, the Viet Minh's ability to bring heavy artillery into position in the surrounding hills led to a decisive victory for them and a catastrophic defeat for the French.

French casualties were around 23,000 killed, wounded, or missing.

### Real life examples of successfully following the principle of fluidity

#### Battle of Midway (1942)

In the Battle of Midway, U.S. forces demonstrated fluidity by quickly adapting to Japanese tactics and launching a surprise counterattack. The U.S. Navy's ability to reposition its carriers and aircraft led to a decisive victory.

U.S. casualties were around 307, while Japanese casualties were estimated at 3,057 killed and 1,000 captured.

#### Battle of El Alamein (1942)

In the Second Battle of El Alamein, Allied forces demonstrated fluidity by adapting to the desert terrain and launching a well-coordinated offensive against Axis forces. The Allies' ability to outmaneuver and encircle the enemy led to a decisive victory.

Allied casualties were around 13,500, while Axis casualties were estimated at 59,000 killed, wounded, or captured.

#### Battle of the Bulge (1944-1945)

During the Battle of the Bulge, Allied forces demonstrated fluidity by rapidly adapting to the German surprise attack. They regrouped and counterattacked, ultimately encircling and defeating the German forces.

Allied casualties were around 185,000, while German casualties were estimated at 100,000 to 120,000.

#### Battle of Inchon (1950)

In the Battle of Inchon, U.N. forces demonstrated fluidity by executing a surprise amphibious landing behind enemy lines. This maneuver caught North Korean forces off guard and allowed for a rapid advance, leading to a decisive victory.

U.N. casualties were around 1,000, while North Korean casualties were estimated at 30,000 to 40,000.

#### Operation Desert Storm (1991)

In Operation Desert Storm, coalition forces employed fluidity by rapidly maneuvering and adapting to changing battlefield conditions. They outflanked and overwhelmed Iraqi forces, leading to a swift victory.

Coalition casualties were around 294, while Iraqi casualties were estimated at 20,000 to 35,000 killed and 75,000 wounded.

### Surprise

In theory, surprise can lead to a decisive victory by catching the enemy off guard and disrupting their plans.
In practice, surprise is often difficult to achieve and may not guarantee success as the enemy may quickly adapt or counterattack.

### ~Overwhelming force~

Overwhelming force is force than is far superior than the enemy's expectations such that it can crush the enemy's will to fight and lead to a swift victory.
It's a better principle than surprise because it does not rely on the enemy being caught off guard, but rather on the sheer power and capability of one's own forces.

### Real life examples of disastrous consequences of following the principle of surprise

#### Battle of the Somme surprise attack (1916)

At the Battle of the Somme, the initial surprise attack by British forces was met with strong German defenses, leading to massive casualties without significant gains. The element of surprise was quickly neutralized by the enemy's preparedness.

British casualties totaled about 420,000, including 57,470 on the first day alone, with 19,240 killed that day

#### Pearl Harbor (1941)

The surprise attack on Pearl Harbor by Japanese forces led to significant damage to the U.S. Pacific Fleet, but it also galvanized American resolve and led to a swift mobilization for war. The initial surprise did not lead to a decisive victory for Japan in the long term with the U.S. quickly recovering and launching a counteroffensive.

The consequences of the attack were disastrous for Japan, as it ultimately led to their defeat in World War II and the loss of their empire.

#### Operation Barbarossa (1941)

The surprise invasion of the Soviet Union by German forces initially achieved significant territorial gains. However, the Soviets quickly adapted, and the harsh winter, along with logistical challenges, ultimately led to a disastrous defeat for the Germans.

The failure to achieve a quick victory and the subsequent Soviet counteroffensive marked a turning point in the war.

#### Kursk campaign (2024-2025)

Armed forces of Ukraine launched a surprise incursion into the Kursk Oblast and clashed with Russian Armed Forces and Russian border guard. Ukrainian troops advanced rapidly up to 35 kilometers inside Russian territory, exploiting a largely under-fortified Russian border.

Ukrainian soldiers suffered around 50,000 casualties and lost significant amounts of equipment, including tanks and armored vehicles. The Russian forces were able to regroup and launch a counteroffensive, leading to a protracted conflict in the region.

### Real life examples of successfully following the principle of overwhelming force

#### Battle of Gaugamela (331 BC)

At the Battle of Gaugamela, Alexander the Great employed overwhelming force by using a well-coordinated phalanx and cavalry charge against the Persian army. The sheer size and discipline of his forces led to a decisive victory, despite being outnumbered.

#### Battle of Cannae (216 BC)

At the Battle of Cannae, Hannibal's Carthaginian forces employed overwhelming force by encircling and annihilating a much larger Roman army. Hannibal's tactical brilliance and the use of terrain allowed him to achieve a decisive victory, with Roman casualties estimated at 50,000 to 70,000 killed or captured.
Hannibal's forces suffered around 6,000 casualties, showcasing the effectiveness of overwhelming force in achieving a decisive victory.
