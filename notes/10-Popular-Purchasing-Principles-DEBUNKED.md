# 10 Popular Purchasing Principles DEBUNKED

Contrary to popular beliefs, good expenses managers aren't soft.

It may seem like they are because some of the most soft purchasing principles that have been widely adopted and celebrated in the purchasing community.

In reality, those principles were widely adopted because there are a lot of soft and bad expenses managers out there.

In fact, good expenses managers are often very firm and in some cases, they are even ruthless.

Let's explore some of the widely adopted purchasing principles that are debunked and rejected by experienced expenses managers.

## ~Trust but verify~

In theory, by trusting your suppliers you can more easily build a long-term relationship with them and get better deals. Verified suppliers are more likely to give you better deals.

In practice, by trusting your suppliers you are more likely to be taken advantage of. Verified suppliers are more likely to take advantage of you because they know that you trust them and that you are less likely to verify their claims and promises after they have been verified.

### Don't rely on trust

From the the purchasing perspective, there are two common problems:

- Non receipts, which is when the supplier doesn't deliver the product.
- Scams, which is when the supplier sells a product that doesn't exist or will be discontinued.

From the supplier perspective, there are also two common problems:

- Non payments, which is when the buyer doesn't pay for the product.
- Abandonments, which is when the buyer doesn't buy the product.

There are solutions that help both the buyer and the seller like escrow accounts and aftermarkets.

#### Escrow accounts

Escrow accounts are accounts that are managed by a third party.
They are often used to hold money until a product is delivered.
If the product is not delivered, the money is returned to the buyer.
If the product is delivered, the money is transferred to the seller.

By purchasing through an escrow account, you can purchase without risking your money.
By selling through an escrow account, the seller sell without risking the product.

#### Aftermarkets

Aftermarkets are markets that are created after the initial sale of a product.
They are often created to sell replacement parts, accessories, and consumables for the main product.

For example:

- If the product is a car, the aftermarket is the car dealership.
- If the product is a printer, the aftermarket is the ink cartridges.
- If the product is a smartphone, the aftermarket is the phone case.

A thriving aftermarket is an indication that the product is successful.

By purchasing products that have a thriving aftermarket, you can purchase without risking buying a product doesn't exist or will be discontinued.
By selling products that have a thriving aftermarket, the seller removes the doubt from the buyer and reduces the risk of purchase abandonment.

## ~Follow strict risk assessment policies.~

In theory, by following strict assessment policies you can more easily identify and mitigate risks.

In practice, by following strict assessment policies you are more likely to miss opportunities and make bad decisions. Strict assessment policies are often too rigid and don't take into account the context of the situation. They are also often too slow and don't take into account the time sensitivity of the situation.

### Assess risks quickly

Assessing quickly enables you to make decisions quickly. Making decisions quickly enables you to take advantage of opportunities quickly.

#### Priorities

By having priorities, you can more quickly assess the potential hazards than if you had to take into account all risks equally and at the same time all the time for all situations and all products.

#### Probabilities

By having probabilities, you can more quickly assess the potential exaggerations and malingering that are often used to inflate the risks of a situation.

## ~Follow your gut.~

In theory, by following your gut you can more easily make decisions and take actions that are aligned with your values and beliefs.

In practice, by following your gut you are more likely to make decisions and take actions that are aligned with your biases and prejudices. It may align with your values and beliefs but it may also be misaligned with common sense and reality. It may also be misaligned with the values and beliefs of your organization.

### Be rational

Make durable decisions that withstand scrutiny.

Make decisions that are durable.

Don't make decisions that are fragile.

#### Justifications

Make sure that you are not making an impulsive decision that you will later regret.

#### Product liabilities

Make sure that the manufacturer has incentives to make a product without major defects and therefore that the product won't have to be recalled.

Make sure that if there are any liabilities, they are the liabilities of the supplier and not the liabilities of the buyer.

## ~Use disruption as a catalyst for innovation and progress~

In theory, disruption of the status quo leads to innovation and progress.

In practice, disruption leads to political polarization and social unrest.

### Be reasonable

Make sure that introducing a new product or a new process will be beneficial to the organization.

#### Simulations

Before introducing a new product or a new process, make sure that you have simulated the impact of the change.

#### System monitors

After introducing a new product or a new process, make sure that you have a system monitor in place to monitor the impact of the change.
